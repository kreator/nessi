# NESSI
NEtworked Self Sovereign Identity

## About NESSI
Nessi is a google chrome extension that allows anyone to isssue and verify networked self sovreign identities.
It's very simple atm, but enough of basic infastructure to iterate on.

## Current Status
Signing and verifying signature trees works, problems exist in the WebRTC transport.
Documentation will be added after we sleep.

## Contributions
If you see something atrocious fix it and open a PR.
We are very aware of some of the bad stuff we've done here, but a hackathon is a hackathon.
